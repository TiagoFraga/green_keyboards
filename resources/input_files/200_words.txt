The villagers of Little Hangleron still called it "the Riddle House," even though it had been many
years since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of
its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face. Once a
fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House
was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.
he Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was "creepy." Half a century ago, something
strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still
liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce. The story had been picked over so many times,
and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.
Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a
fine summer's morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had
entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.
The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many.
